LEVEL: GOLD
MESSAGE: Let’s get one thing straight—dance moms don’t play when it comes to photos. We don’t want “cute.” We want iconic. We want goosebumps. We want “why am I crying at a leap?” levels of drama. 💁‍♀️📸✨<br> <a href="https://www.foxfxphoto.com/">FOXFX Photography</a> didn’t just deliver—she understood the assignment… when it wasn’t even assigned. Out of pure heart and love for the craft, Abby showed up, captured magic, and then hit us with the ultimate encore by becoming one of our first GOLD sponsors for the 2025–2026 season. 🥹💛 <br> She didn’t have to—but she did. And that’s the kind of energy we are here for. Abby, you’re not just behind the lens—you’re behind our glittery gratitude and standing ovation. 👑📷 <br>You are the moment. Thank you for showing up for our dancers with talent, heart, and sparkle to spare. We love you. We stan. We’ll probably name a rhinestone after you. <br>Let’s go, 2025–2026. We’ve got GOLD vibes and a camera queen on our side. 💃🔥
